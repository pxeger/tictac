# credit to Vyxal for pioneering the "putting docs in a YAML file" approach

# format:
#   # if the op has multiple overloads with different behaviour, document them separately with the same `op` value
# - op: 'A'  # or whatever the syntax is
#   overload: [input, types]
#   summary: *brief* human-readable summary of what it does (markdown)
#   # details should include the input order if non-trivial
#   details: |
#     (optional): longer-form details of behaviour (markdown)
#   # if two keywords are prefixes of each other, only the longer one is needed (e.g. `subtraction` already covers searches for `subtract`)
#   # keywords should also include common symbols representing the operation even if they aren't the ones used for them in Tictac.
#   keywords: [list, of, search, terms, that, relate, to, this, operation]
#   # categories should be a subset of the fixed set of categories
#   categories: [list, of, categories]
#   # (optional) this should only be included when it's not obvious
#   mnemonic: short description of how to remember that this does what it does
